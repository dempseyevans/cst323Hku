###### Above shows the music application being ran with no visible errors. This portion of the code works with the albums to display the tracks. At this point in the activity there were no visible changes that would show. The purpose of this section of the activity was to make the data (tracks, lyrics, and videos) interactive. One part of this uses click events for when a user clicks on a component that they want more information for.

###### Above is an image of the application running at the end of part 6. Bootstrap was utilized in this portion to display the form when creating a new album. The code used aligned with the given code in the solutions. There was a visual update to the application, however it still does not look the way that it should. The purpose of this section is to create a new form to allow new albums to be added to the application. One particular thing I learned in this section is that when using bootstrap the "class" in the tag needs to be changed because "class" is a JavaScript keyword.

###### The image above shows the display when the use clicks to create a new album. I was unable to get any new visuals to show in the application. I checked that my code matched the given code and had no errors. The purpose of this section is to add the ability to edit an existing album. This is done by using props to determine if the component is new, and if not, allows the component to be modified.
