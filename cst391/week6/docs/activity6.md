###### Above are two images of my attempts at running part 1 with the support of the provided solutions. After the error in the first image I went back and fixed all errors in MusicAPI and musicapp. I then ran music again and the outcome was the second image.

#### Research Quesetions
###### There were many new features on this application. When using data from the JSON file the callback function is used. Callback functions basically allow the programs to multitask. Such as the program continuing to run while the album list updates. These callbacks are used for event handlers in this program. React hooks were used as well. This allows the current state to be returned as a value. Axios is a newly introduced library that is used in this application. It is used to get data from the rest service.

###### Above is the outcome of running the application. I verified multipe times that the code was copied correctly and fixed any errors. After going through the process I was still unable to manage to get the screen to show any information in the localhost. I attempted to reach other URL's within the application as well.

#### Research Quesetions
###### This application had a higher focus on routes. Like the previous appication, callbacks and hooks are used. This allows the location state to be used. Private routes were a new concept which blocks users who are not logged into the application from accessing the private API's. Each page is given it's own js file then is used with the created private routes in the PrivateRoutes.js to apply the API in the APP.js file.

###### I verified that the code was coppied correctly and there were no visual changes to the application. I was unable to find any errors in the application that would stop the visual aspect of the application from running correctly.

#### Research Questions
####### This activity continued to build on the music app. A new component was made to manage the cards and search through the albums. The app.js file was modified to utilize the new components. The navbar from bootstrap was utilized again as well.
